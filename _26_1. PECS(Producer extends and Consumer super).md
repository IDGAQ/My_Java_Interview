# Producer extends and Consumer super

## 什么意思？
#### 如果你只从list里get data,用```extends``` (current type and below)
#### 如果你只往list输入data,用```super``` （current type and above)

---
 If you are only pulling items from a generic collection, 
 it is a producer and you should use ```extends```; 
 
 if you are only stuffing items in, 
 it is a consumer and you should use ```super```;
 
 If you do both with the same collection, 
 you shouldn't use either ```extends``` or ```super```;
