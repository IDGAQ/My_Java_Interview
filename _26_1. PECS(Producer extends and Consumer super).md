# Producer extends and Consumer super
---
 If you are only pulling items from a generic collection, 
 it is a producer and you should use ```extends```; 
 
 if you are only stuffing items in, 
 it is a consumer and you should use ```super```;
 
 If you do both with the same collection, 
 you shouldn't use either ```java extends``` or ```super```;
