## DNS查询过程 ##

Q:
  DNS寻找地址的过程是什么?
  
A:
  Step 1: OS Recursive Query to DNS Resolver ↓
    "www.xxx.com" -> send 'Recursive Query' -> 'DNS resolver' ->  return IP address/error
    
    Since the operating system doesn’t know where “www.google.com” is, it queries a 'DNS resolver'.
    The query the OS sends is a 'Recursive Query', means that the resolver has to complete the query, 
    either returning an IP address or an error.
    (Generally, DNS resolver is provided by your Internet Service Provider, such as ATnT; or an alternative, such as Google DNS)

  Step2:  DNS Resolver Iterative Query to the Root Server ↓
  
  
    
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
```
