# 接口和抽象类的区别(Interface和Abstract_class)
---
---

语法：
Abstract class: method could be abstract or with constructors
Interface     : methods are all abstract

用途：
Abstract class: permits you to make functionality that subclasses can implement or override
Interface     : only permits you to state functionality but not to implement it.
