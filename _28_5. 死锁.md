# 死锁
---

### 死锁是什么？(会卡住的锁）
When the functions in two/more threads call each other

For example:（伪代码）
```java

Synchonized 
  Police.ask(Thief);

Synchronized
Thief.ask(Police);

```
### 为什么会卡住？

1. When Thread 1 runs police.ask(), Thread 2 runs Thief.ask().
2. They are both waiting for each other, but can't finish.
3. Because they have each other's function/variable within
