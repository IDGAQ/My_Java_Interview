__Ethernet__
```
With Ethernet, data travels through the network inside units called frames, 
with each frame containing source and destination addresses. 
If data from multiple computers are transmitted at the same time and a collision happens, 
the systems wait before transmitting again.

__Token Ring__
```
In a Token Ring network, all devices are connected to the network, 
with empty data frames circulating around the ring. 
A computer is granted the right to transmit data
